# briefparser Package Suite

## Description

The `briefparserpublic` package is a public version of the `briefparser` suite, designed for the analysis of BRIEF (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function) data. This package is a censored version, omitting licensed information and norm data contained in the full `briefparser` packages, due to proprietary restrictions from the BRIEF manuals.

### Features

The `briefparser` suite facilitates comprehensive analysis of BRIEF assessments, focusing on:

-   **Batch data processing**: Processing of large numbers of BRIEF questionnaire resonses.
-   **Composite and Subscale Score Calculation**: Leveraging responses from BRIEF questionnaires, users can compute both composite scores and subscale scores.
-   **Data Input Versatility**: Accept responses, raw scores, and T-scores as inputs.
-   **Automated Scoring**: Generate T-scores, clinical cutoff scores, and summary statistics to assist in data interpretation.

The BRIEF instruments are tools within psychological assessment, targeted at evaluating executive functions like inhibition, shifting, emotional control, initiation, working memory, planning/organization, and monitoring. They encompass assessments for various demographics, including adults, adolescents, and children.

### Current Supported Versions

The `briefparser` suite includes:

-   **Available R-package**:
    -   **`briefparserA`**: Processes the BRIEF-Adult version (BRIEF-A) using US norm data.
-   **In-development R-packages**:
    -   **`briefparser2self`**: (Details pending)
    -   **`briefparser2parent`**: (Details pending)
    -   **`briefparser2teacher`**: (Details pending)

These packages incorporate norm data to aid in the scoring and interpretation of BRIEF scores through clinical T-score benchmarks.

### Usage and limitations

While the `briefparser` packages are designed to enhance the utility of BRIEF instruments in research, users should consult the BRIEF manuals and associated literature for comprehensive guidance on interpretation. These packages are not intended for clinical interpretation.

### Publications

Here are publications where the `briefparser` packages have been used:
